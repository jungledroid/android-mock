Android Mock is a framework for mocking interfaces and classes on the Dalvik VM.

Android Mock is written on top of EasyMock 2.4, reproducing the same grammar, syntax and usage patterns.  If you're familiar with EasyMock, then using Android Mock to write tests will be simple.  For more information on writing tests, take a look at WritingTestsUsingAndroidMock.

Android Mock generates mocks at Compile time which are then used at Runtime.  For instructions on how to use Android Mock from the command line, see UsingAndroidMock. To setup Android Mock in your Eclipse Android test project, take a look at the instructions at http://android-mock.googlecode.com/files/AndroidMockinEclipse.pdf
