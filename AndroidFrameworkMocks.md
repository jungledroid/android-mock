android-framework-mocks.jar contains pre-built mocks for all of the mockable Android SDK classes, for all of the supported Android SDKs.  For a class to be mockable, it must be possible to subclass it.

At compile time, AndroidMockGenerator will pull out the relevant mocks (as determined by the @UsesMocks annotations present in your tests) for every SDK version, and include them in the compilation (javac) output.

These mocks are then automatically included in the dex step, since they sit alongside the .class files normally generated by a call to javac.
